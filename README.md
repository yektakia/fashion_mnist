(a) Plot the changes in accuracy and loss of the model during training. When does the model start to overfit?

(b) In the single-layer MLP network, vary the number of hidden neurons between 100 and 400 and report the accuracy on the test data as a graph. Test the model with a two-layer network, experimenting with different values for the number of neurons in both layers. Present the results in a table and analyze them.

(c) Use two methods to prevent overfitting. Explain each method and show the results on the test and training data again.

(d) Repeat section (a) for several different algorithms for weight updates, and compare and analyze them on a single graph.

(e) Bonus section: Explain the CNN model and train it on this dataset. Change the number of kernels and report the results. Repeat the above steps for this model, including tables and graphs, and compare and analyze the results.
